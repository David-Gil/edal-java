{"name":"EDAL","tagline":"ncWMS and the Environmental Data Abstraction Layer libraries.","body":"## What is ncWMS?\r\nncWMS is a [Web Map Service](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Service) for displaying environmental data\r\n\r\n## What is EDAL?\r\nEDAL is the Environmental Data Abstraction Layer - a set of libraries which provide a data model for dealing with environmental datatypes, and numerous utility routines for reading, manipulating, and plotting this data, as well as serving it over a WMS.\r\n\r\n## Getting started with ncWMS\r\nncWMS is designed to run in a servlet container such as [Tomcat](http://tomcat.apache.org/) or [Glassfish](https://glassfish.java.net/).  However, we do provide a standalone version which uses an embedded [Winstone](http://winstone.sourceforge.net/) servlet container to allow users to quickly try it out.\r\n### Standalone version\r\nTODO Add a download link.\r\nTODO Highlight the lack of security in the standalone version\r\nThe standalone version can be run from the command line using the command:\r\n```\r\njava -jar ncWMS-2.0-standalone.jar\r\n```\r\nThis will run the embedded servlet container with ncWMS.  You can access the web interface to ncWMS at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/)\r\n\r\n### Servlet container version\r\nTODO Add a download link\r\nTODO Explain security config\r\n\r\n### Adding data\r\nTODO Explain admin interface briefly\r\nTODO Gridded CF (NetCDF/GRIB) data by default\r\nTODO Non-default data reader (with link to dev guide/cookbook)\r\n\r\n### Using the Godiva 3 interface\r\nTODO image(?) showing overview\r\nTODO Link to Godiva 3 quickstart guide.\r\n\r\n### Developing ncWMS\r\nncWMS can be extended in a number of ways for custom behaviour.  These include:\r\n* Adding new colour palettes\r\n* Precisely defining new styles using custom [SLDs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Styled_Layer_Descriptor)\r\n* Adding readers for new data formats\r\n* Adding plugins to perform on-the-fly manipulation of existing data layers\r\n\r\nTODO add link to dev cookbook for how to do these\r\n\r\n## Authors and Contributors\r\n@jonblower, @guygriffiths, @N-Lin, @purplecat","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
