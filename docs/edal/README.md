# EDAL Cookbook

The EDAL (Environmental Data Abstraction Layer) libraries are a set of Java libraries used to manipulate and plot environmental data.  They were created from the code of the original ncWMS project and are the foundation upon which [ncWMS2](../ncwms/README.md) is built.  This cookbook gives an overview of some of the core features and common use-cases for EDAL, all with examples.  Each example program can also be found in the [examples](https://github.com/Reading-eScience-Centre/edal-java/tree/master/examples) module of EDAL and can be downloaded, modified, and run as required.
