## Linear opacity transform {#linear-opacity-transform}

The following example XML shows a reanalysis of sea surface temperature as a colour map. The analysis error is represented by a linear opacity transform. The more uncertain an area is the more transparent it appears. The opacity transform only applies to the layer.
[include](linear_opacity_transform.xml)

The resulting output image is shown below:

The legend for the map is below:
